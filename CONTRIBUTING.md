## Commit message format

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for commit messages and expect from you the same.
The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```
